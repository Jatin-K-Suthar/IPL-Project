This is a React project, which has multiple functionalities like looking through teams, viewing differnt players, displaying their names, photos, roles, and such.
It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and further down, libraries like React. It was used to induce a component based environment, which is personally my favourite feature of React as a whole. Nothing quite like having everything sorted and connected. Modular programming for the win as always :)

It is a user-friendly application and I hope you enjoy your experience going through it. Especially if you're a fan of cricket; which, in India, is virtually assured.

Constructive criticism is appreciated!
